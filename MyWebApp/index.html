    <h2 style="text-align: center; color:blue;">Introduction of Navajo Nation Water Quality Web App </h2>
    <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 600;"> Nearly 30% of households in the Navajo Nation (NN), a sovereign
        Indigenous nation in the Southwestern United States, lack access to running water from regulated public water
        systems (PWS). Water hauling from unregulated water sources is common in this region and may present a
        disproportionate burden of exposure to harmful toxicants like uranium and arsenic. Research shows that wells in
        closer proximity to one of the more than 500 abandoned uranium mines (AUMs) on the NN have higher counts of
        uranium and arsenic that exceed the federally mandated maximum contaminant level (MCL) for each, 10 ppb and 30
        ppm, respectively. One of the main challenges in addressing this problem is the lack of available information to
        water users and decision-makers in the NN about which wells are unsafe. Researchers at the University of New
        Mexico METALS Superfund Research Program (SRP) have compiled a database of water quality measurements from 1101
        wells within the reservation using data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Church Rock Uranium Monitoring
        Project (CRUMP), Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency (NNEPA), U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC),
        Tolani Lake Enterprises, Northern Arizona University (NAU), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE), and other
        researchers. To date, none of these compiled data have been disseminated publicly and in a format that
        facilitates easy interpretation.</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 600;"> The aim of this project, therefore, is to produce an interactive
        web mapping tool that allows users to make informed inferences and decisions about the quality of unregulated
        water sources on the NN. Bearing in mind principles of usability and utility in a web map interface and design
        (Nielsen 1995; Robinson et al. 2005; Roth and Harrower 2008), we will adopt three recommendations by Roth and
        Harrower (2008). </p>
    <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 600;">First, we will provide avenues for data analytics that respond to
        specific needs and wants of various people â€“ this may be water users looking to understand the quality of their
        specific water source, applied or data scientists who are interested in interactions of analytes across a
        geographic area, or policy-makers looking to identify needs of specific communities within the study area.
        Second, we will ensure map browsing flexibility by enabling pan, zoom, and filter options. Finally, we will
        avoid a minimalist design, thereby making the functions of the interface clearly defined and easy to use. </p>
    <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 600;">This web map will also begin to address the CARE (collective
        benefit, the authority to control, responsibility, and ethics) principle of Indigenous data sovereignty, which
        acknowledges the tensions between recent calls for data sharing that may be at odds with Indigenous rights and
        interests. This app may serve to initiate a process of compiling disparate water quality datasets into a usable
        format that addresses the right and need of the Navajo people to understand some of the mechanisms that
        determine their health (Carroll, Rodriguez-Lonebear, and Martinez 2019; Walter et al. 2021).
